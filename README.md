# ResumeApplicationTracker

A work in progress. Testing my ability to learn new languages & technologies and develop on the fly!
This version is deprecated and being used as a proof of concept. Currently creating a polished web app version - see https://github.com/icyandrew360/AppTracker for updates on development.

 - Save company job applications
 - Save date, application status
 - Display all job applications and status in order submitted
 - Edit application status
 - Saving to database
  
## TODO:
 - Migrate to a web application
 - Implement Google Firebase Cloud Firestore API
 - File uploads for each application (resume, transcript)
